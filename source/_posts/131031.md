# Polymeric micelles

## Introduction 
## Polymeric micelles

* The biological properties of materials used in forming micelles
* The methods of preparation(take examples)
* The micellization and micelle morphology. the relationship between (the characteristic of aggregation, properties of molecular aggregates with different sizes, and the parameters of the initial and final states of the micellar solution)

<!--more-->

## Some kinds of "smart" micelles

* pH-sensitive micelles 
	* The physiological basis
	* The principle of loading and releasing compounds
	* The recent applications or results  (in vitro  and in vivo)[for a certain problem of some kinds of compounds with similar chemical properties]
